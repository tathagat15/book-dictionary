# Books Directory

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` command inside the project
3. For development run `npm run start:dev`
4. For production run `npm run start`

## Problem Statement
A book dictionary with 4 endpoints for 4 most basic methods : GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

You’d use GET for getting all books or getting only one book by id. With the POST method, you can add a new book to the list. You’d need the PUT method for updating the existing book, and it’s evident that with the DELETE method, you will remove the book from the list.

For this kind of application, you don’t have to use the database, and for this app, you can start with data collected as a JSON file.
